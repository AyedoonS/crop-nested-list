# crop-nested-list
A basic function in Python3 that crops a nested list (2d list)

Given a nested list, <m> and two points* on the nested list <corner_1> 
and <corner_2>, crops the map so that these two points are now
corners of a new list, to be returned.

*these points are 'coordinates', in the form (row, column),
of a 2-dimensional list*
